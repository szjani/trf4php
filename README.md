trf4php
=======

This is a transaction manager facade library. It wraps and hides database handler libraries thus you can whenever switch to another one. The idea came from the Spring framwework.

Features
--------

Currently there is one 'real' binding implementation: [trf4php/trf4php-doctrine](https://github.com/szjani/trf4php-doctrine)

Feel free to implement a binding for your preferred database handling framework.
